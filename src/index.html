        <h1 id="welcome"><a href="/">Welcome to {dev.talk}</a></h1>
        <p>
          <b>{dev.talk}</b> (pronounced "dev dot talk") is a community-driven monthly meetup bringing together software engineers and tech professionals in the Bournemouth and Dorset area. </p>
        <p>Free to attend and run by community volunteers, we create an inclusive space where developers of all experience levels can learn, share knowledge, and connect. </p>
        <p> Each meetup features sessions from community members (mostly of a technical nature), with time for networking and discussions between talks. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, you'll find a welcoming environment to explore new ideas and "geek out" with fellow tech enthusiasts. </p>
        <p> To extend our reach beyond the in-person events, all sessions (with speaker permission) are recorded and shared on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@devdottalk">YouTube Channel</a>, creating an accessible resource for the wider developer community. </p>
        <p> Our mission is simple: build a thriving, supportive tech community in Dorset where everyone can grow professionally while making meaningful connections. </p>

            <p> As developers, you are building new tools and disrupting the way others operate. having a tool is great, but then adopting users to change their behaviors requires separate focus, time and resources. Sometimes, we need to let users "destroy" the tool first, only to learn how to make them "love" it later. I'll give some examples on how I went about this challenge in the teams I worked with and how important is the work between developers, users, stakeholders, project leads, change managers and so on.</p>

        <p><b>{dev.talk}</b> was created by <a href="https://blog.markoliver.website/Bio">Mark Oliver</a> in 2024. He saw that Bournemouth was lacking a software engineering based meetup despite being a <a href="https://blog.markoliver.website/Bournemouth-Tech-Meetup-Rebirth">Tech Hub</a> on the South Coast of the UK, and as Wilton Knight once said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otzJszJ9MnA">"one person can make a difference"</a>, so Mark decided to create the meetup, and the community around it.</p>
