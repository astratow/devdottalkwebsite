    <h1>Welcome to {dev.talk}</h1>
    <p><b>{dev.talk}</b> is a FREE monthly meetup event for software engineers and related disciplines of all levels in and around the Bournemouth, Dorset, UK area.
    </p>
    <p>We aim to come together regularly and share knowledge allowing us all to learn and grow in our chosen fields and careers.
    </p>
    <p>It will be a relaxed environment where everyone is welcome from all backgrounds and technical levels.
    </p>
    <p>We will have a chance to network between the sessions run by community members.
    </p>
    <p>All sessions will be recorded and accessible on YouTube after the sessions (assuming consent from the speaker)
    </p>
    <p>Our goal is to bring a sense of community to the Software Engineers of Dorset, and a chance to truly “geek out” in a safe place.
    </p>
    <p>We have a <a href="https://reconnectconference.co.uk/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a> that will be strictly adhered to. We want to be welcoming to everyone no matter who they are, what skill level they have or where they come from.
    </p>
    <p>We will be aiming for talks (& lightning talks) that are of any level, and any software engineering based skill. This will include deep dives into technical subjects, soft skills, mental health, career progression etc.
    </p>
    <p>All levels of speaking/presentation skills will be accepted, and actively encouraged. We want <b>{dev.talk}</b> to feel like friends who support each other.
