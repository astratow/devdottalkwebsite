    <h1>Welcome to {dev.talk}</h1>
    <p><b>{dev.talk}</b> (pronounced "dev dot talk") is a FREE monthly meetup event for software engineers and related
      disciplines of all levels in and around the Bournemouth, Dorset, UK area run by volunteers within the community.
    </p>
    <p>We aim to come together regularly and share knowledge allowing us all to learn and grow in our chosen fields and
      careers.
    </p>
    <p>It will be a relaxed environment where everyone is welcome from all backgrounds and technical levels.
    </p>
    <p>We will have a chance to network between the sessions run by community members.
    </p>
    <p>All sessions will be recorded and accessible on YouTube after the sessions (assuming consent from the speaker)
    </p>
    <p>Our goal is to bring a sense of community to the Software Engineers of Dorset, and a chance to truly “geek out”
      in a safe place.
    </p>

      take part.
      We aim for talks (& lightning talks) that are of any length (5 min to 90 min), and any software engineering based
      skill.
      These can include dives into technical subjects, soft skills, mental health, career progression etc.
      We can provide help such as brainstorming of ideas for sessions, how to structure your session, an opportunity to
      practice your session over video call.
    </p>
    <p>Our event topics are around Software Development.</p>
    <p>The location will be around Bournemouth, UK.</p>
    <p>We expect around 30 to 50 attendees for each event.</p>
    <p>All levels of speaking/presentation skills will be accepted, and actively encouraged. We want <b>{dev.talk}</b>
      to feel like friends who support each other.

    <h2 id="venues"><a href="#venues">Venues</a></h2>
    <p>In order to run the dev.talk sessions, we need a free space to host the attendees and speakers. Our recent events
      are bringing over 50 attendees each time, so getting a space that fits them all is tricky.
      If you know of a venue that may be able to host us for free (dev.talk is run by volunteers and does not use
      sponsors).</p>
    <h3>Venue Requirements</h3>
    <p>It needs to be able to:
      <ul>
      <li>Host at least 60 people</li>
      <li>Capable of showing presentations on a large screen bigger than 80inches, with the ability to plugin a device via HDMI.</li>
      <li>Seating for all attendees in the style of a classroom / lecture theatre (i.e. good view of the screen)</li>
      <li>Be accessible for those with disabilities</li>
      <li>Be accessible in the evening from 6:30pm to 9:30pm</li>
      <li>Parking nearby</li>
      <li>WiFi available to attendees</li>
      <li>Allows food and drink to be served (Tea & Coffee, Soft drinks and Biscuits)</li>
      <li>Allows filming of the event and venue</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Volunteers</h2>
    <p>Do you want to help out at a future event? </p>
    <p>We always need people to:
      <ul>
        <li>welcome and check-in attendees</li>
        <li>help setup and pack down afterwards</li>
        <li>tech support for the speakers</li>
        <li>help film the event</li>
      </ul> 
      If this is something you are interested in doing, then please <a href="mailto:volunteers@devdottalk.uk">Contact
        us</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p><b>{dev.talk}</b> was created by <a href="https://blog.markoliver.website/Bio">Mark Oliver</a> in 2024. He saw
      that Bournemouth was lacking a software engineering based meetup despite being a Tech Hub on the South Coast of
      the UK, and as Wilton Knight once said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otzJszJ9MnA">"one person can make
        a difference"</a>, so Mark decided to create the meetup, and the community around it.</p>
    <h2>Buy us a Coffee</h2>
    <p>Buy the <b>{dev.talk}</b> team a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/devdottalk">coffee with Ko-Fi.</a>. Any monies given
      will be used to provide refreshments at the following meetup.</p>
